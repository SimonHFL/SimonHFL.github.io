<p>I’m a second year industrial PhD student collaborating with Siteimprove under the supervision of Anders Søgaard at the CoAStaL group, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.</br>
The focus of my PhD currently is on improving the quality of Grammatical Error Correction systems, specifically focusing on low-resource approaches. I am also interested in the use of reinforcement learning as a way to improve NLP systems.
